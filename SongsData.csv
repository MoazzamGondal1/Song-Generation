Kendrick-Lamar,United In Grief,Hip Hop,"I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
Tell them, tell 'em, tell them the truth
I hope you find some paradise (tell them, tell 'em the truth)
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell them your-

I've been goin' through somethin'
One thousand, eight hundred and 55 days
I've been goin' through somethin'
Be afraid

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killin' her
What is a relative, making repetitive narratives on how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents evil thirst

What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity

I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (whoa)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (whoa)
Started to feel like it's only one answer to everything, I don't know where it is (whoa)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (whoa)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Whoa)"
Kendrick-Lamar,N95,Hip Hop,"Hello, new world
All the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside
But they still lied
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (take that shit off)

Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (take it off)

Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh-huh
Ugh, you ugly as fuck (you outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs, you steppin' or what? (You outta pocket)
Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (shoot, shoot, shoot, you out of pocket)"
Kendrick-Lamar,Worldwide Steppers,Hip Hop,"Kodak Black, Oklama
Eckhart Tolle
And this here is the big stepper

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and-

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through

Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messaging bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort

I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi"
Kendrick-Lamar,Die Hard,Hip Hop,"I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
I told you not to cry and held you close to me

I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop
Serafina, flame in ice
Where I'd be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

Do you love me? (Okay) Do you trust me? (Okay)
Can I trust you? (Okay) Don't judge me (okay)
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly (okay)
Too passionate, it gets ugly (okay)
Mmm, ah-ah"
Kendrick-Lamar,Father Time,Hip Hop,"You really need some therapy
Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talking about?
Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck
Shit, everybody stupid
Yeah, well, you need to talk to someone
Reach out to Eckhart

I come from a generation of home invasions
And I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see

Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughing with my friends, they don't know my life

Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, ""That boy is exhausted"", he said, ""Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin"", I got up quick

I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice"
Kendrick-Lamar,Rich (Interlude),Hip Hop,"I learned in trappin', in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin' my dick sucked after the show
I ain't gonna lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we find our own

Runnin' in stores, kickin' in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon' live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify
Everybody ""gang-gang""
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink

Niggas shittin' where you sleep
Nigga shittin' where you eat
Who'da ever knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah"
Kendrick-Lamar,Rich Spirit,Hip Hop,"Takin' my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain't never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite
Universal shift, I'm in a groove and celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shakin' hand, firm grip rule
72 ways, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M's for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans, the GT diamond flippin' the kickstand (ooh)

Rich nigga, broke phone (ah)
Tryna keep the balance, I'm stayin' strong (ooh)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (yeah)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (ooh)
Ayy, bitch, I'm attractive (ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh (ooh)
Bitch, I'm attractive (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh

The morality can wait, feedback on low latency
I'm glitchin' from the face as my thoughts grow sacredly
I'm runnin' out of space, ask Whitney she okay
Never mind a hundred K, why you lyin' on Benjamin?
He turnin' in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn't give this shit away"
Kendrick-Lamar,We Cry Together,Hip Hop,"Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
This is what the world sounds like (nah, f- you)

Oh, wow, okay
You got me f- up
F- you, f- you

I swear, I'm tired of these emotional, ungrateful
(Shut the f- up)
Unstable, confrontational dumb-
You wanna bring a- down, even when I'm tryna do right
We could go our separate ways right now
You could move on with your life
(I swear to God) you love a pity party, I won't show up
Always act like your s- don't stink, motherf-, grow up (man)
Forever late for sh-, won't buy sh-, sit around and deny sh- (man)
F- around on a side-, then come f- up my -

What? F- up yo' -? You must be bleedin' and some more -
I don't know -, f- yo' feelings (you on some-)
See, I don't know why you likе playin' mind games with me (mind games, man)
I ain't slow nor ditsy, I know whеn you bein' distant
I know when you fake busy (come on, brah)
Get out yo' feelings and miss me with that reverse psychology
Man, b- you trippin', who got you that Rollie chain?
And who put that car in my name?
What you think? I'ma kiss yo' -?
Nah n-, you f- lame

You know what? F- (f- you)
Nah, f- you (nah, f- you)
F- you (nah, f- you)
Nah, f- you (f- you)
F- you (f- you)
F- you (nah)

Wastin' my time and energy tryna be good to you
Lost friends, family, gained more enemies 'cause of you
Starin' at me in Zara, h- scratchin' my cars up
Shoulda followed my mind in '09 and just moved to Georgia
Oh, what, that's my fault now?
You power trippin' or guilt trippin'? I held your a- down (okay)
You just kept me down, that's a big difference"
Kendrick-Lamar,Purple Hearts,Hip Hop,"Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the f- up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby

This my undisputed truth, uh-huh
My life is like forbidden fruit, my b- know better than I do
A woman's worth, I barely went to church
I'd rather fast with you than f- it up
F- with skirts 'cause I'm rational
A n- still gon' be a-, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don't trust their true intentions
I'm not in the music business, I been in the human business
Whole life been social distant, h- like, ""When you not trippin'?""

I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon' judge your life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them h- is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they'll bless you back

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but"
Kendrick-Lamar,Count Me Out,Hip Hop,"We may not know which way to go on this dark road

(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult

Session ten, breakthrough

One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's one of you now
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?

It's a game to me, where the bedroom at? (And I'm tripping and falling)
Sleep, I ain't never had affairs with that
What's fed when the hearts and the words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back

I care too much, wanna share too much (and I'm tripping and falling)
In my head too much, I shut down too
I ain't there too much, I'm a complex soul
They layered me up, then broke me down
And morality's dust, I lack in trust

This time around, I trust myself (and I'm tripping and falling)
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself

Masks on the babies, mask on an opp (and I'm tripping and falling)
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in the lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride

Look myself in the mirror (and I'm tripping and falling)
Amityville, I ain't seen nothing scarier (on and on and on and on)"
Kendrick-Lamar,Crown,Hip Hop,"You walk around, like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can't say no
Go out the way to make the coin available
That's what I call love

The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

But the time, it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say, ""No"" and all you've done gives them amnesia
One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)

They idolize and praise your name across the nation
Tap the feed and nod the head for confirmation
Promise that you keep the music in rotation
That's what I call love (that's what I call love)"
Kendrick-Lamar,Silent Hill,Hip Hop,"Hey, oh, yo
Why oh, why oh, why oh, why you keep f- with me?
You gon' make me jump out my skin, believe me

Push these n- off me like, ""Huh""
Push these n- off me like, ""Huh""
Push these n- off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' the snakes, I'm pushin' the fakes
I'm pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' 'em all off me like, huh (yeah)

Aha, I be immune to sh- (aha)
Tucking the broom and sh- (aha)
They want to assume and sh- (aha)
Know you a choke, my - is too close
I howl at the moon and sh- (aha)
Know the results, the ballot is in, man, I'm 'bout to boom again (aha)
You funny, dawg
Peek-a-boo, can't hide behind your money, dawg
A week or two, I meditate on runnin' lost
Swerve, swerve, swerve, shake the currents off, yeah

Push these n- off me like, ""Huh""
Push these n- off me like, ""Huh""
Push these n- off me like, ""Huh""
Pushin' the snakes, I'm pushin' the fakes
I'm pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh"""
Kendrick-Lamar,Savior (Interlude),Hip Hop,"If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim
Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child
And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you

You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in the county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shooting niggas, blood on the highway
Crosses on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take everything that I ask for

Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showing a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did 43 shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way, put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love

Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped out the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love"

Kendrick-Lamar,Auntie Diaries,Hip Hop,"Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't-
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
This is how we conceptualize human beings

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max's, gold chains and curl kits
'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played underground verbatim and stayed local

My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinking, ""I want me a bad bitch when I get big""
They hug on the corner like California king
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six by nines, keeping the music up under me

My auntie is a man now
I asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, ""ain't no telling
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Calling him anything but broke was less offending""

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say ""faggot""
""Faggot, faggot, faggot,"" we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it"
Kendrick-Lamar,Mr. Morale,Hip Hop,"It was one of the worst performances I've seen in my life
I couldn't sleep last night because I felt this sh-
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee!

Enoch, your father's just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must have a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off writin' off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I'm a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes I'm afraid of my open mind

On my mind and it's heavy
Tear you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
It ain't about the business, shut the door now
It's a celebration
And if this sh- ain't bussin', what's it for now?

Steppin' out when the weight lifts"
Kendrick-Lamar,Mother I Sober,Hip Hop,"I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standing on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five

I still feel it weighing on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clinging to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Staring at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I remember looking in the mirror knowing I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, ""Did he touch you Kendrick?""
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""
Frozen moments, still holding on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhyming, coping mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help

Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watching, live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear tell me that she sees me
""Did he touch you?"" I said ""No"" again, still they didn't believe me"
Kendrick-Lamar,Mirror,Hip Hop,"(I choose me)

The pressure's taking over me, it's beginning to loom
Better if I spare your feelings and tell you the truth
Lately, I redirected my point of view
You won't grow waitin' on me

I can't live in the matrix, huh
Rather fall short of your graces, huh
This time I won't trade places, huh
Not about who's right, who's wrong, huh
Evolve, the only thing known, huh
Ask me when I'm coming home, huh
Blink twice again, I'm gone

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry

She woke up in the morning for the daily news
I was so low and mourning through the family feuds"
Kendrick-Lamar,The Heart Part 5,Hip Hop,"As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment

Residue burned, missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain
Covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain

Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved

I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams, the culture

(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Head tricker, walk up closer
Ain't no Photoshoppin'

Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya"
Kendrick-Lamar,Black Panther,Hip Hop,"Wait

King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we living again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed

King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners, district, and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken"
Kendrick-Lamar,All The Stars,Soundtrack,"Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)

All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence and
Calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?"

This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (what you want)

And it's like that, lil' bitch
MVP, I don't get no sleep, no, I don't like that, lil' bitch
Bust that open, I want that ocean, yeah that bite back, lil' bitch
Do it bite back, lil' bitch? Need two life jackets, lil' bitch
I ain't gon' hold you, I ain't gon' press you, never control you
I ain't gon' front you, keep it 100, I don't know you
Boss like Top Dawg, bossed my life up, crossin' over
Stutter steppin', got a Hall of Fame in all my posters

Without you, I'm all alone

Who gon' pray for me?

I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain

I'm bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive
You're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?

Anything you want
I can explain, I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me? (I can explain)
Let me explain it, ah yes"

Kendrick-Lamar,untitled 08 | 09.06.2014.,Hip Hop,"Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have"

But the thing you know best is ""Bought a TEC"" is cap
'Cause you could get jacked on sight if you ain't precise
Figure-four fistfights, make the homies take flight
Flight, take off on you, like I ain't goin' to work today
Most of your favorite rappers pussy, I know it hurt to say
My mama told me hold my brother down, 'cause she was workin' late
My cousin turned Muslim the minute he beat that murder case
I've been all around the world and I've been doin' my thing-thing
Some say that I'm the reason while y'all gangbang
While you was in grade school, I'm takin' fades, fool
Crippin' is international, so now we gettin' paid, fool
They tryna rig the culture, you could say they vultures

Check it out
Everybody got a third eye, right?
But when you don't take heed, you fail to follow your instincts
Things could go bad
So bad that you might find yourself
In a hole you can't dig yo' way out of

Bustin' at the honeycomb, money on the mental
Ski mask, gloves, two choppers, and a pistol
Outside dark like thoughts niggas thinking
We Hitboy strike, leave sauce niggas leakin'
Speaking on Vix on the list for the lay down
How much the worth, plus dirt where they stay now
Hustle gets whoever, we ain't carin' 'bout the odds
Move with precision, and catch 'em by surprise

Ride for this money, yeah, we gotta run it smooth
Scopin' niggas, hope to win it, slidin' on this move
Stupid ammunition for this mission, it's a groove
If everybody play they part, then can't none of us lose"

I gotta be, I gotta me a better me
Top dog, whole 'nother pedigree

Feet in the sand as I dance on your TV

Yeah, I make this shit look organic
And this is from the most recognized on the planet
Damn it

Some times I just don't know which ones to push
Been said ladies are like an oven,
So it may take a little longer to cook
A man just wants to get to eating
See all he need is just a sprinkle of seasoning
And what we talking 'bout for drinking?
The right amount of fat around the meat, and let's go

What can I do to make it faster? (Girl, go)
Saw that I understand the pain in you
I ain't got the kinda apparatus (No)
That makes everything I'm looking at see-through
Throwing clues, way out my range, won't make it better
All these games will just delay us and upset us

You know I just can't read your mind
Why you mad? Use your words
You see how hard I'm trying, so why this game of Jeopardy tonight?

Self driven, this the life I chose

Black swan on my toes, watch for the pot holes
I'd rather focus on how much water the pot holds
Started out breaking records, now we breaking records

It's not a conflict of interest
Cuh, them niggas with the business
West Coast niggas rockin' them Timberlands deep up in them trenches
It's no different

Neither one play games when swingin' for them fences
We want the finer things, the shit that's expensive
The shit that hit 'em either close range or at a distance
If God for me, nigga, why bother?
I got my game from the Godfather (woof)
Top of the food chain, rock bottom
And handled my business when it was my problem
G shit, nigga flossin' with a gold chain

Who remember growing up eating Corn Flakes?
Spend the night at granny house 'cause momma on a date
So you ate what you ate, and you ate it quick
'Cause you knew your grandma, she ain't play that shit
Paw Paw, he stayed in another house
With another woman, she a brick house
Growing up fast was a shit show
It's a few things I learned from the gеt go

A few folks in my fam fell down
Then they got they feet back on solid ground
And came back around and showed me how to fail
See there's a lesson every time a nigga take a L
Dead or in jail, that's the fairytale

Snoop-Dogg,Outside The Box (feat. Nate Dogg),Hip Hop,"Yeah, this is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one
Welcome back

Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

We came from a place where our hearts are pure
People wanna know what we're marchin' for
Grouped up, scooped up all my pals
Flavor for days, so much style
They can't even put it in a box now (wow)

So I blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters (my chapters)
Stomped down, pterodactyl raptors
Game's sustained, my New Jersey's in the rafters

Statisticians, they keep up with it
No sleep 'til they get it
And once they got it, they count it
So I learned how to dismount it

My landin' was perfect, a man with a purpose
I learned to resurface, a boss but no workers

Yeah, busters keep talkin' and I'm tyin' 'em up
Duct tape, gasoline, yeah, we fine 'em up
Talkin' wreck out the neck, get your check for respect
It's a promise, not a threat, we are back in the West

Four-four dealers, lions and gorillas
Stars and fulfillers, scars and cat villas
Balls and rack dealers, ignored you rap n-
You touched up the frame and f- up the game -damn"

All greens, by all means, we into that
Front, back, run it up, now run it back
For a repost, cuz, I need a hundred racks
Top dollar, hip-hop, the Impala
No bark, all bite, Rottweiler
Test him out, stressed him out, no
Popped him out and stretched him out, oh (get it good now)

Hand on my dick and my hand on my gun
One is for shootin' and one is for fun
Niggas trippin' off of 151
Black & Milds burnin' under the sun
Black and brown kids young or they dumb?
Sack a town, where your mom and them from?
Gather 'round, run in all of your shit
But what did you get? (New stick)

I say it's up (I got a new stick), that mean it's stuck
Run out of bullets (I got a new stick), you run out of luck
One in the cribbo (I got a new stick) and one in the truck
One in the tippo 'cause bloody ain't duck
Step a foot up on the yard and get struck
Everyone I grew around was a thug
Thought he was a shooter, thought he was tough
Found his body coolin' out in the cut

Shit, Fulton County, 50 cal' in the tuck
Fuck around and shoot the cavalry up

We got calibers, categorized

J-Cole,Freedom of Speech,Hip Hop,"Y'all niggas know what it is when I show up (King Cole)
The energy switch in this motherfucker

Came through with a bad bitch in tight britches
Made the hoe book her own flight, I'm type vicious
Black boy fly, stupid racks, oysters on my plate
So much bread I think I got white privilege
Access to five-star rooms and white bitches
I dreamed it like Bing Crosby, dreamed a white Christmas
After shows fuckin' on the slutty snow bunnies
I done came to the conclusion that I only like sisters

And that might be a hard pill to swallow for a few
She had dreams of fuckin' Cole and even her father would approve
(Yes, honey, you can fuck him) look what a dollar bill'll do
Made them bougie bitches workin' up in Prada smile at you

Yeah
Yeah (get this shit off my mind, off my chest)
Yeah (nah mean?)
Yeah

With every record, I be askin' the masses to tune your hearts to me
I represent intelligent niggas that grew up harshly
But lately I've been questionin', second guessin'
Whether or not I've got somethin' to offer since I done eluded poverty
Or has the money watered me down? That truth is hard for me
Like the second time I got cut from the junior varsity
Fightin' back tears, I promised to switch gears
And said to myself, ""Whatever you do, you won't do it partially""

From this day forward, I move with a new ferocity
Ferrari coupe velocity, a fail proof philosophy"

And don't check your watch, you know the time
Cole World, Killa Cam, niggas is fuckin' finished (yeah)

This shit too easy for me now
Nigga, Cole been goin' plat' since back when CDs was around
What you sold, I triple that, I can't believe these fuckin' clowns
Look how everybody clappin'
When your 30-song album do a measly hundred thou'
If I'm bettin' on myself, then I'll completely double down
If you hated on a nigga, please don't greet me with a pound
I be stayin' out the way, but if the beef do come around
Could put a M right on your head, you Luigi brother now

Trace my steps all in this game, you could see we cover ground
Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
Vivid memories, niggas start to squeeze, we duckin' down
So many shells left on the ground, it make the Easter Bunny proud
I get up, dust my clothes off, sleep is the cousin of death
No plans to doze off, the streets, it don't come with a ref
I never sold soft, just creeped where the hustlers crept
And got they O's off, you reach, niggas uppin' like Steph"
J-Cole,a m a r i,Hip Hop,"Bada-ba, bada-ba
Bada-ba, da-da
Off-Season
Let's work, hey

Plottin' my escape, this game rot a nigga's faith
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' 80 on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple bean jumping
Good dope leave a fiend krumping
Made it out, it gotta mean something

Either you gon' hustle hard or that nigga Uncle Sam got yo' ass re-enlisting
2-6, murder scene pumping
Better leave it tucked if y'ain't dumping
Pow, pow, nigga, he slumping
12 comin', we ain't seen nothing"
J-Cole,m y . l i f e,Hip Hop,"Oh, you came there, God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, Lord
No matter how, no matter how long it take, yeah
No matter how long it take, n-
Oh, God, yeah
You better be

Spiralin' up, just like a rich n- staircase (spiral up)
No-fly zone, please stay the f- out my airspace (out my face)
N- say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at SquareSpace

Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought that I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'
A block full of opps, now the cops in an orbit
Guess somebody got popped and they knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see nathin'
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prosper that's formin' against me

N-, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm done with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You n- just cubs but no, not the ones in big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics

To profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustlin' instincts"

We offing niggas (ayy, that's right)
The fuck you talking 'bout? (That's right, ayy)
Offing niggas (yeah, ayy, yeah)
(Vocal up a little more, hey)

Uh, applying pressure
Started my grind with crime festers
And nines showing like they in they second trimesters
That's why a nigga's throw a shot or two online
I pay no mind to their benign gestures

Nigga, please, I got my mind on much bigger things to say the least
My latest speeches sound like they was released by David East (what up East?)
Verses hit hard, never pitched hard or played the streets
These niggas whips are behind closed doors, can't pay the lease, uh

Ain't nothing wrong with living check to check
'Cause most have to (I ain't saying that)
Instead of capping
Why don't you talk about being a broke rapper? (I ain't saying that)
That's a perspective I respect because it's real
What it's like to be nice as fuck, but got to stress to pay the bills

That was me in '08, seeing no cake"

Ain't nothin' I want more

I said, ""I ain't come here to waste my time""
I came here
They gave us a chance to get in like we asked for
And that's, that's what we here to do (yeah, nigga, 26)
The job still ain't done (straight up)
But I, I said, ""You, you know what I'm here for""

Back on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity
I got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity
Shit profound, we propagating more profanity
Paid off collections from recollections of calamity (oh shit, look, that nigga 'bout to shoot)
The shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (oh shit, run, nigga, run)"
J-Cole,1 0 0 . m i l ‘,Hip Hop,"How come a n- ain't enter his prime?
Still gettin' better after all this time

One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind

Never peddled rock, never said a lot, only what need to be said
Got a little guap, when you get a lot, won't no b- leave you on read
Don't push me, n- my feet on the ledge
This game is like follow the leader
If you lookin' closely enough, then you'll see that I led

The moves that I made, the people I fed, the evil I ducked
They minds is too feeble, they lean on they crutch
I'm bleedin' from fightin' my demons head up
When I get defeated, believe I get up
I come from a city most n- ain't heard of
Until they popped in my first CD, now look

I'm on that Mount Rushmore, you n- can't front no more
B- I'ma reign until FEMA show up"

Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil
It left so many, R.I.P.
Pride is the Devil
Think it got a hold on me
Pride is the Devil, yeah, uh

Terrified, paranoid
I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything?
Or will I be destroyed? Uh

Terrified, paranoid
I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything?
Or will I be destroyed? Yeah

Bright lights pass me in the city, it's emergency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my 30s, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but movin' like I got no sense of urgency

Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollow me

Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be"
J-Cole,l e t . g o . m y . h a n d,Hip Hop,"Soldier's song, marching on, on
Hoping to see home
If I die, before I
See your smile, just one more time

Sometimes I question whether this sh- matters
Putting substance into something and the world's so used to instant gratification
I found this instrumental on my phone while on vacation
Ib sent it a year ago or so
I probably heard it before but slept on it, you know?
Sh- don't always connect as soon as you press play
At times you gotta step away, do some living
Let time provide a new prescription, giving truer vision

I dibble dabble in a few religions
My homie constantly telling me 'bout Quran, putting me on
I read a few pages and recognize the wisdom in it
But I ain't got the discipline for sticking with it
Now I'm on the way to London, got a show for seven digits
I'm wondering just when did I become my biggest critic?
I wanna be my biggest fan
Like how I was when didn't nobody know my jams
Today, my son said, ""Dad, let go my hand""

Reminded me one day he's gonna be his own man
And my job is to make sure he's equipped"
J-Cole,i n t e r l u d e,Hip Hop,"I'm a living little good thing (yeah)
It's like you never lived for me, yeah
Mama said you was a good thing, uh
Good, good, good, yeah

Yeah
We came a long way, man, we done came a long way
And we sitting on top of this shit
This shit can go one or two ways
This shit can go up, it can go down
Either way, nigga, I'm prepared
Feel me? Yeah

I be coming in peace, but fuck me
Best beware the others
This shit deep, undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week, seen yo' mama weep"
J-Cole,t h e . c l i m b . b a c k,Hip Hop,"Are you doin' this work to facilitate growth or to become famous?
Which is more important?
Getting or letting go?
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)

Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come back to life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up
As if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red
For my nigga found dead too soon (Bitch, I'm back out-)

Yeah
To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped, like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts, we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it

I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sho' ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe to toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole, to blast at ya
Bass masters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sho blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called ""Foldin Clothes"", and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do, make a diamond, they just rhymin'"
J-Cole,c l o s e,Hip Hop,"Yeah
Close
Ville-matic
One, one, one, one, one, two
One, one, two, one, one, two, one
One, two, one, one, listen

Close, I stare at my dreams as they approach
Gotta be patient and trust in God, He the coach
Temptations are taking a shortcut, but I don't
'Cause I ain't tryna be a almost, when I get it, I'ma float
Gone are the days we was close
Now when I see you, I look at you just like a ghost
A shell of your former self, so caught up with that dope
Two-two singin' two different notes and you know I gotta coast

Nothin' but a dollar and some hope
Up in NY, but damn, what hurts me the most?"
J-Cole,h u n g e r . o n . h i l l s i d e,Hip Hop,"Alright now, alright now
God has a plan for you (God won't stop me)
And all you've got to do (love won't stop, stop me)
Is believe, believe, believe (yeah)

Sh- gon' get hard, keep your head strong
If I quit now, then I'm dead wrong
Fightin' off this hunger for hours
Big stepper, n-, don't get stepped on
The money might fade, but respect don't
Still gon' be me when success gone
I don't speak the language of cowards
I walk through the flame like I'm Teflon

I sucked up the pain and I kept goin'
Whole world know my namе, b-, my rep strong
We sold out in less than a hour
Thеse words I still sang like I'm slept on
I sin, so I can't cast the next stone
Unless it's baguettes 'round my neck bone
Inside of my frame lies a power
You can't get this game from no TED Talk

I wanna know if they understand me
I put it all on A, ain't no plan B"

I done seen it all, oh my God

I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear

Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I'm cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that's my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

Roll up and pour me a drink up, let's get fucked up
Roll up

Uh, I'm drunk at a party, ain't put down my cup
The fuck is my water? I pick this shit up
Then drank all the water and threw this shit up
It's ash in my cup, I'm mad as a muh', huh
I push pack like USPS, you is a bitch

Ayy, yo, yo, shut the fuck, ayy
Don't even rap, nigga, you
Ayy, hold on
Hold the fuck up, nigga

Tell me why you wanna come get high tonight
I only got one reason, I'm top dog tonight
I let the broads borrow my room and I got caught tonight
Drunken partying, slobbering, 'nother sloppy night

Always fight with my mama, but look, on my leave night
I'll call her, when I'm a baller, I promise that I'ma score you
Until then, I'ma ignore you, it's nothing personal (Sorry)
I'm just tryna fuck a couple girls and go
Can't do that while I'm on the phone
I'm not a mother's boy, I'm a motherfucker"

On God, I been waitin' for one of y'all pussy niggas to buck
Still starving, ribs touching
Touch the team and you get touched like homescreen buttons
Hoes scream loud, Jennifer Hudson when them thangs start bustin'
Alright

Shit talk and slick talk
Pissed off, stick talk
Diss track, get mad
Rap niggas big trash
Your squad, my squad
Mismatched, pissants
Cheese chase, gym rats
Picture paint, Rembrandts
Tree trunk, thin branch
I leave, come back
This fall, diss all y'all niggas I came up with
My, what a bit of a change up
These niggas lame, we in minimal danger
I got the banger, just give me the next

Put the motherfuckin' bank on it"

Niggas want, mmh, niggas want, mmh
Chase the money, Chase the money

Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due

Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
2-6 boy, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum

Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slipping, send him to Raleigh

Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel

Hesitation always get you killed, nigga

I wanna pop my shit
I wanna cop my whip in cash
On that note, pull up on them folks
In an all black Ghost like Christmas Past

This shit's ass
Low-key rich with the same outfit that I did just have
Pardon the smoke, that's just my staff"

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish

But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit

Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters

Eminem,Walk On Water,Hip Hop,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the— it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!"""

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

""Wait! Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No, you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?"

We can chill, split half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut
I'll cut my toes off and step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fucking drill
How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
Summers Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby, crank the shit
'Cause it's your goddamn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shawty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
""Settle ya fuckin' ass down I'm ready for combat, man""
Get it? Calm Batman
Nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like mom's CAT scans
'Cause they fucking go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spazz like a goddamn Taz', yeah

You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards"
Eminem,Higher,Hip Hop,"Yeah
You know I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah, I do, haha

I look at me now I'm thinkin, ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did, it's nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands

They hollerin', ""Shady""
Yellin' it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get a chance to get a crowd
I'll flip it around and have a crowd give me the chance
I've done it all, man
But in actuality I haven't, yet

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey (oh-oh-oh)
Really I have no idea
All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey (oh-oh-oh)
Really I have no idea
All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get

But I mean it's maybe I have more patience than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch"

Eminem,From The D 2 The LBC,Hip Hop,
Eminem,Nowhere Fast,Hip Hop,"Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just

Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a"
Eminem,Fall,College Rock,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
(It's too loud)
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud

Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away

These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face (Yuh)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)"
Eminem,Fast Lane,Hip Hop,"Uh, first verse, uh, I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn

Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past
So that basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Bradys, you still fly kites daily

Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice Ice Baby""
Screamin', ""Shady 'til I die"", like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
'Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus

You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital ""B"" with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit"
Eminem,You’re Never Over,Hip Hop,"The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means ""suicide"" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world
When you're the only one with the balls in your shorts

To leave their jaws on the floors with no re-morse
Remember that when they get to dogging you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to blogging about bologna, I'm not gonna stop
The saga continue, no stopping the force Obi, I'm mopping the floors
With them, I keep trying pass it, but they keep on dropping the torch
And it won't be long till this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me we are knocking on doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be

Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't traveling down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold, living without you"
Eminem,3 a.m.,Hip Hop,
Eminem,Space Bound,Hip Hop,"We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's
Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you

250, 000 miles on a clear night in June"

Eminem,Crack A Bottle,Hip Hop,"Oh, ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

(Okay, let's go)
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes"

I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience

Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the earth
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn

I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and scrappin' that property all for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy

I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '96, worse nightmare to side chicks
Some things are just meant to be

(Deal with life)
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more

Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation
Then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged
Ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
The segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights

Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up back in the cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the motel, ayy
Yeah, Bizzare's tryna get a lapdance
Off a Xan next to Jack Dan' (ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like, goddamn
She's like, that's harassment, I'm like, yeah, and? (Woo)

Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy
She said, fuck off and threw her liquor at me
It's one of those kinda nights

When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah

And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (yeah)

Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

I'm not happy here (nah)
With her
Rather have you (yeah)
Rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there)
With him
Rather have me (I know, but)
We just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)

Brain"" Heenan which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (hey, hey)

In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)

I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper

My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological"

Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest, why I'm so lost?
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you, I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

I'm so much like my father
You would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium
Then chase it with booze
One little taste it'll do
Maybe I'll take and snooze
Then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round
I'm gettin' loaded (haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh?
Double entendre (hello darkness, my old friend)

I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

Now I'm starin' at the room
Service menu off a Benzo
I can hear the music
Continue to crescendo
I can see the whole venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (hello darkness my old friend)
'Cause I keep peakin' out the curtain from the hotel

The music is so loud
But it's almost as though
I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd?
I thought this was sold out

Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)

Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black

But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit"

Dad, what?
What'd I fuckin' tell you about turnin' off the lights?"
Eminem,Stepdad,Hip Hop,"Ayo
(This song's about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if see ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures that I draw
Shit that I've already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts

All I can hear is drama with mom and him
I can always hear arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker
Who sticks his dick in my mom (my mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him"
Eminem,Marsh,Hip Hop,"My name is Marsh and this world, I'm out of it (out of it)
'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm startin' to sound like alphabet
Ha! I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was misled by the sound of it
How am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills
Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk

'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb
But the word fuckin' ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb

Hoe thinks her snatch is magical, but that's how she attracts
Men and who traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow

In fact, it'll be nothing to throw that lil' Bitch with a capital
B out the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit I'll aim at then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'd be great but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like invisible scratch pickles
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit

Slugger and crapped it, I'd like to introduce myself

They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at them with no regrets, and I'm Hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing

I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will

I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four-inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Farrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, a bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine

Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beat boxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shotters
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, kill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will

Yeah, I slaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Abra-, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented"
Eminem,Alfred (Outro),Hip Hop,"This concludes our danse macabre
Portions of the proceeding were recorded
As for the rest of it"
Eminem,Alfred (Intro),Hip Hop,"Thus far, this album has provided musical accompaniment to make your passing pleasant"
Eminem,Black Magic,Hip Hop,"Black magic, night walker (yeah)
She haunts me like no other (feel like)
Nobody told me (I don't know)
Love is pain, oh (I know we just met)
Black magic, dark water (but it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (it's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains

We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (sneeze)
Last time, I broke her collar bone, she's intolerablе (yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phеnomenal, though

We're an unlikely pair (yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (yeah)
People don't like us together, but like we care (not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals
For her with both of my feet bare (yeah)

But soon as I ask to hit (ask to hit)
It's like she grabs a switch (grabs a switch)
And turns me over her knee (yeah)
'Cause my ass is whipped, yeah"
Eminem,Alfred’s Theme,Hip Hop,"Before I check the mic (check, check, one, two)
I give it an extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (yeah)

I throw on my tux, then I (yeah) give zero fucks, then I (yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (uh), cup my nuts, then I (yeah)
Check my ball hair (what?), make sure it's all there (yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (yeah)
It's Music to Be Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill like a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (what?)

Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (visine) every time I drop (eye drop)

So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself

And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial

'Cause if I do, it's see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack, but always get attacked (yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (ew, yuck)

But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like

But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's
Like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (tossed my crayons)

Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and"
Eminem,Tone Deaf,Hip Hop,"Yeah, I'm sorry (huh?)
What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (out), yeah (I need autotune)
Yeah

It's my alter ego's fault
These evil thoughts can be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat, doze off to ""Rico Suave"" (look it up)
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel
A backpack full of Paxil, a black satchel, a knapsack
And a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels

Girl, let's go back, back to my castle (yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (stands for you, oh)
Wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (what?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you
Guess that's what the Molly and X do (what the fuck?)
'Cause who the fuck am I laying next to? (Huh)

But ever since D-Nice To Tha Rescue, Fila Fresh Crew (uh)
I been a lab rat (yeah) from a test tube (uh)
I'm goin' in like the Red Roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks (yeah)
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're Scarface

In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race duckin' saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is I'm drivin' 'em all crazy (hahaha)

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (yeah, yeah)

I see the rap game, then attack the verses (uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (yeah)

Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah, I do, haha

I look at me now I'm thinkin, ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did, it's nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands

They hollerin', ""Shady""
Yellin' it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get a chance to get a crowd
I'll flip it around and have a crowd give me the chance
I've done it all, man
But in actuality I haven't, yet

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey (oh-oh-oh)
Really I have no idea
All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey (oh-oh-oh)
Really I have no idea
All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get

But I mean it's maybe I have more patience than I'm able to admit

I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and scrappin' that property all for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy

I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '96, worse nightmare to side chicks
Some things are just meant to be

This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more

Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation
Then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged
Ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
The segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

We should be datin', she's from Cleveland

Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy
She said, fuck off and threw her liquor at me
It's one of those kinda nights

Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

I'm not happy here (nah)
With her
Rather have you (yeah)
Rather have me too

Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again

Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest, why I'm so lost?
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you, I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

I'm so much like my father
You would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium
Then chase it with booze
One little taste it'll do
Maybe I'll take and snooze
Then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round
I'm gettin' loaded (haha)

Continue to crescendo
I can see the whole venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (hello darkness my old friend)
'Cause I keep peakin' out the curtain from the hotel

The music is so loud

'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)

Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black

But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been doubted

Mike Will the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee

Must have missed my CAT scan that day (yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia's an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist

You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain

Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to

Eminem,Normal,Hardcore Rap,"Yo, how do I keep (I don't know what's up with these hoes)
Getting in relationships like this (I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not till she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean
And now she starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house in her evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory

Therefore, I better prepare for it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group

Shoot"

That's how much we have in common (yah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (yah)
That's how much we have in common (yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (yah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires is new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G

Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (no!)
We don't got nothin' in common (no!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (woo!)

I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it

Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it"
Eminem,Kamikaze,Hardcore Rap,
Eminem,Fall,College Rock,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
(It's too loud)
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud

Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away

These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face (Yuh)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)"

I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk and fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like, ""One day, you'll come back to me""

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy)
Making beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe how every day gets worse for me

I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality"

Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you handle that?
Like yikky-yeah check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that

I get a little bit bigger
But, then, I'll admit

Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am?

So this is what you meant when you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top, don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check

(Sing for me)
(I don't ever wanna let you down)
I don't ever wanna leave this town (Las Vegas)

I'm just the same as I was"

Sometimes, I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, and a day in a life
Mixing it up, checkin' it twice
Trying to breathe, starting to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price (you pay)

Leave behind your heart and cast (away)
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than (the prey)
And you're standing on the edge face up

'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world"

Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I'm done

Stuck in my head and they don't leave
Fillin' up the silence with these notes
I don't want them to go

Ghosts follow me around these days
Haunting my head and house
My mind is crazy loud
But I won't give in to it
Take it all in stride

This life is such a ride, I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life, I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher ground"
Imagine-Dragons,Crushed,Alternative,"I suppose she's supposed to be
Exactly what they want her to be
So pretty and pink, necklace and ring

And I wish they'd go away, go away
'Cause it's crushing me
It's crushing me""

So pretty in red, eyes are all dead
What they haven't said gets stuck in your head"
Imagine-Dragons,Take It Easy,Alternative,"Last week I came to you
I didn't know what to do
Yeah, man, sometimes I lie

Someday everybody's gonna die

Take it easy on me
I need some lullabies
They tell me heaven's just a lie
Well, I'm not surprised
Tell me that you know, no, you don't
Yeah, you're just like me
Can't we just all hope for the best?
Take it easy

Money don't grow on trees"
Imagine-Dragons,Waves,Alternative,"21 years, she figured it out
She started a job, she's feeling it out
And for once, it feels right
Was feeling like the prime of her life

But all of that is just a dream
Shattered now, and everything's changed
With one car and one night
It's driving through the prime of your life

Took your freedom, there's no reason
Just keep breathing
Time doesn't hear if you ask it to wait

La, da-da-da-da, la, da-da-da-da
So own all your tears and just roll with the waves
La, da-da-da-da, la, da-da-da-da

Each night I go to sleep and dream

I'm swimming in the deep end
You're my buoy and I'm sinking
Life flies by me, but I'm thinking
You saved my life and now

I'm happy

Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around"

She took me half the way there"
The-Beatles,We Can Work It Out (Remastered 2015),Pop,"Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's all right
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out, and get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out"
The-Beatles,Paperback Writer (Remastered 2015),Pop,"Paperback writer (paperback writer, writer)

Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear

Paperback writer

It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail"
The-Beatles,Yellow Submarine (Remastered 2015),Rock,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed on to the sun

And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard"
The-Beatles,Eleanor Rigby (Remastered 2015),Folk-Rock,"Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?"
The-Beatles,All You Need Is Love (Remastered 2015),British Invasion,"Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love

There is nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say
But you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

No one who can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do
But can learn to be you in time
It's easy

All You Need Is Love"

Friday night arrives without a suitcase"
The-Beatles,Hey Jude (Remastered 2015),Rock,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do"

Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back"
The-Beatles,Something (Remastered 2015),Pop,"Something in the way she moves

That I don't need no other lover"
The-Beatles,Come Together (Remastered 2015),Pop,"Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeball, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, ""I know you, you know me""
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together
Right now
Over me"

It's the time of your lives
Break down, break down

Has found its way to me
It's out, and it's out, and it's out

But I won't be defeated, oh no

What if cards don't go my way
Then it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me
It's only superstition"
Ed-Sheeran,Call on me (feat. Ed Sheeran),French Pop,"C'est l'heure où les videurs deviennent gentils
Même avec les gens qui font peur et sont pas beaux la nuit
Ces pieds qui collent me donnent le sentiment
Qu'il faut qu'on dorme maintenant
Quand dans la boîte c'est moite et t'es pas là
Que c'est bientôt ""Les lacs du Connemara""
J'tente de danser pour plus penser mais panser le passé

J'fais comme si j'avais l'habitude de tout ça
Je la sens, la solitude, sans toi

Call on me, brother
I should let it be over
Every high, every low, they will come then they'll go
To feel alive, you've got to take the blows, you know
So call on me, please, brother

It is the nights when I'm drunk that it hits me most"
Ed-Sheeran,Lonely Lovers,Hip Hop,"Sometimes, you can lose someone
And you won't ever feel the same no more
Wanna give up, it don't feel right
But you don't wanna feel this pain no more

Bad things come to those that don't deserve it
Why do I only pray when I'm hurtin'?
I might pour another glass
Wish I had one more chance to just have one more dance
A river full of tears, I'm swimmin' with the sharks
It's tearin' me apart, yeah
But we'll dance again in Heaven, my friend (Heaven, my friend)

It's been a while since I broke down in conversation
Little moments trigger memories when I talk about you
Hide the pain when only last year, it was always blatant
Acceptance comes eventually, man, 'cause what can you do?

Shut the world out, embrace the hurt
Nothin' can make it worse
So finish the bottle and open another, light up, inhale the burn
Everyone gets their turn
I still can't say the words, ""I miss you""

It's livin' wrong, getting this fucked up to forget
But I don't wanna be livin' the day filled up with regret
With words I should've said"
Ed-Sheeran,Groundwork,Hip Hop,"Coming to ya from the outskirts
I've been waitin' outside for time but now they gonna let me in
But you gotta know one thing, all I ever do is win
Because of that groundwork (yeah)
I've been settin' this mic alight until the fight takes over

My team build upon many years of groundwork
Cuban look like yellow yam, points to the 'Gram
You know that pound work (pound work), you know how my sound work
Miss the fantastic, I'm a static, make them crowds surf
Lone ranger, I am always on the outskirts
Grab my .40, start playing 40-40
If the demon starts to haunt me (hahahahahaha), they leave and love it
My cannon said, ""Just fuck it"", on these fingers that will touch it

On the peak like Warren Buffett, like Norris, I just chuck it
Three stars in the moon, flick my wrist and I just bruk it (I just bruk it)
You know my steez
You get the borough to your belly button like Priest from Dancehall Queen
Hardcore settings, never been PG larger 'cause it's easy
Extraterrestrial, ET, thousand grams
Weezy connecting people, BT shoe
Flew off-key, Weezy move for the shadows, creepy
Look for the glasses, Stevie, and when the rhythm all easy, light white, easy-peasy

Know it's PDL in the dunya, I make a man unknown T, like munya"
Ed-Sheeran,Are You Entertained (feat. Ed Sheeran),Pop,"Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?

Every time, every night is a loose one
And every flight, you know that I put the crew on
You say that I dropped off, well, then tell me what you've done
I'm still in my winnin' phase, yeah, I been away
Are you entertained? I'm gone (yeah)

The god in me, that's what I'm constantly summoning
I love the climb, I don't care where the summit is
Funny when people be sayin' I peaked (ha)
Retired my parents, they live at the beach
Models and freaks is my track record (yeah)
I made my homies my staff members
Got myself lit to give y'all the light
Usin' my mind to attract better

At first, when adversity came, I said, ""Why me?""
Now I be staring at doubt sayin', ""Try me""
Kyrie, I handle it well
They still takin' shots, tryna hand me a L, but I pass on that
Anger, I try not to act on that
I'ma just transmute it"
Ed-Sheeran,Sigue,Latin,"Dale

Sigue
Que a mí me gusta todo lo que exhibes
Yo puedo tocar los temas
Que miren cómo te recorro el cuerpo entero
Baby, tú solo sigue
Tú eres sola pa mí (yeah)

Yo quiero darte tu regalo antes de Navidad
Tu mentalidad es mi debilidad
Llama a tu amiga pa que hagamos una trinidad
Si tú eres sólida, te pongo líquida

Esta noche tú y yo sí nos vamo' a joder
Sí nos vamo' a joder, sí nos vamo' a joder
Yo estoy puesto, dime si estás puesta pa beber
Si estás puesta pa beber, si estás puesta pa beber

Mami, si me sigues, nos vamos pa'l hotel
Tú ere' la primera, pa ti no hay un top ten"
Ed-Sheeran,Forever My Love,Latin,"La luz de tu mirar, tu hermoso caminar
No existe nadie como tú
The sky magenta blue, it's only me and you
Your eyes lit up are just the moon

Sé que habrán momentos de sufrimiento
But we'll be okay
No soy perfecto, pero

En dondequiera que estés, ahí estaré
Hoy y mañana, por siempre, mi amor
Y si me voy, recuerda que
For now and tomorrow, forever my love"
Adele,Strangers By Nature,Pop,"I'll be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart
For all of my lovers in the present and in the dark
Every anniversary, I'll pay respects and say I'm sorry
For they never stood the chances if they could
When no one knows what it's like to be us

I've never seen the sky this color before"
Adele,Easy On Me,Pop,"There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So, go easy on me"
Adele,My Little Love,Pop,"Mmh, mmh

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm finding it hard to be here, sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone, and you're the only one who can save me

Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel like that?
Do you like-like me?
You know, mommy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?"
Adele,Cry Your Heart Out,Pop,"Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace

When I walk in a room, I'm invisible
I feel like a ghost
All my friends keep on tellin' me that
This feeling won't last, mm
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself
I swear I'm dead in the eyes
I have nothin' to feel no more, I can't even cry

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering"
Adele,Oh My God,Pop,"I ain't got too much time to spend
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mm, yeah, mm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mm, yeah, mm, yeah

Oh my god, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle I cannot fight"
Adele,Can I Get It,Pop,"Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make it, if I can make your heart my home

Throw me to the water (water)
I don't care how deep or shallow (water)
Because my heart can pound like thunder (water)
And your love, and your love can set me free (water)

Oh, I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm and your rhyme
All I want is for you to be mine, mine

So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)"
Adele,I Drink Wine,Pop,"How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow

When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something, you just want me

Why am I obsessing about the things I can't control?"
Adele,All Night Parking (with Erroll Garner) Interlude,Pop,"I know you've got things to do (I do too)
I just wanna spend all my time with you (feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress, don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party, I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you all night long

I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)"
Adele,Woman Like Me,Pop,"You're driving me away, give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you, but not in this way
Don't think you quite understand who you have on your hands
How can you not see just how good for you I am?

I know that you've been hurt before, that's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in, 'cause I only want to be the cure
If you don't choose to grow, we ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere

Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad, a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free, and it is key"
Adele,Hold On,Pop,"Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off

It's hard to hold onto who I am
When I'm stumbling in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling
With myself with no chance to win

(Hold on)
Let time be patient
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come)
Just hold, hold on

I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress"
Adele,To Be Loved,Pop,"I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself

All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie"
Adele,Love Is A Game,Pop,"All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely, you know
That I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable
Of learning to grow I am

My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see

That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling)
What a cruel thing (Cruel thing)"
Adele,Hello,Pop,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside"
Adele,Send My Love (To Your New Lover),Contemporary R&B,"Just the guitar? Okay, cool"
Adele,I Miss You,Pop,"I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light"
Adele,When We Were Young,Soul,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment?
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me, of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here"
Adele,Remedy,Pop,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be
Every story has it's scars

But when the pain cuts you deep
And when the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see"
Adele,Water Under the Bridge,Pop,"If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?

And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me"
Adele,River Lea,Pop,"Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child, I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

Oh, I can't go back
But the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain"
Adele,Love In The Dark,Pop,"Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore

Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me"
Adele,Rolling in the Deep,Pop,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair"
Adele,He Won't Go,Pop,"Some say, I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew

I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you've left behind

Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified
I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying

I heard his voice today"
Adele,Melt My Heart to Stone,Pop,"Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love"
Adele,Right As Rain,Pop,"Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say, ""I chose to be alone""
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off, and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off, we
Won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything"
Adele,My Same,Pop,"Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact

I say we've only known each other a year
You say, ""Pfft, I've known you longer, my dear""
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do"
Adele,Tired,Pop,"Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile"
Adele,Daydreamer,Pop,"Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw-dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch"
Adele,Best for Last,Pop,"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me? Yeah"
Adele,Crazy For You,Pop,"Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am, I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race"
Adele,Melt My Heart to Stone,Pop,"Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love"
Adele,First Love,Pop,"So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind"
Adele,My Same,Pop,"Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact

I say we've only known each other a year
You say, ""Pfft, I've known you longer, my dear""
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do"
Adele,"That's It, I Quit, I'm Movin' On (Live at Hotel Cafe)",Pop,"When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door and leave me standing there
Oh, honey, that's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it every place, yeah
Yeah, that's it
Honey, I quit, I'm movin' on
Oh"
Adele,Crazy For You (Live at Hotel Cafe),Pop,"Found myself today
Singing out loud your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am, I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool"
Adele,Daydreamer (Live at Hotel Cafe),Pop,"Daydreamer
Sitting on the seat, soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past and feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks, is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch, and he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh"
John-Legend,Rounds (Piano Version),R&B,"Cotton candy fingertips
Paint my lips
I'ma slip inside those hips
Ease your grip, yeah

Been waitin', where have you been hidin'?
I'm fiendin' like I never had it
But now I got you wrapped around me
I'll go at it like a savage

Baby, I owe you rounds
You know I'm gon' put it down"
John-Legend,By Your Side,R&B,"Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down when your down on your knees?
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you aren't
I-I, I-I, I, I-I
And if only you could see into me, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there"
John-Legend,Wonder Woman (Piano Version),R&B,"Yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh

When I'm lost, when I'm low
How do you always know?
Oh, you're right there to save me
At the end of my road

When I'm floatin' in space
How do you stay in place?
When the whole world is caving
Oh, you're my saving' grace

You make me wonder, woman
How do you do it?
Some superpower
I don't understand

You make me wonder, woman"
John-Legend,Speak In Tongues (Piano Version),R&B,"When we talk to each other
Speak in tongues
Got our own little language
One on one
I could taste every drip from your lips, let it flow
Breathe on me, go, baby, go
Oh, speak to me, speak to me in tongues

Saying what we want without saying it
How we knowing all these motions like we planned it
Freaking on this frequency, the passion's got high, yeah
Building our momentum, is you ready?
Don't you feel the tension getting heavy?
Say it with your soul, I got the secret code
Nobody, nobody knows

It must be something in the air
Good love flowing everywhere
Must be something in your vibe
Lets me know what you want, I know what you like"
John-Legend,Bridge Over Troubled Water,R&B,"When you're weary and feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't, can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Yeah

When you're down and out
Oh, when you're on the street"
John-Legend,Rounds,R&B,"Cotton candy fingertips
Paint my lips
I'ma slip inside those hips
Ease your grip, yeah

Been waitin', where have you been hidin'?
I'm fiendin' like I never had it
But now I got you wrapped around me
I'll go at it like a savage

Baby, I owe you rounds
You know I'm gon' put it down"
John-Legend,Waterslide,R&B,"Oh, no
Slip inside those hips

Let's go down together
And take a waterslide
Save your drama for later
We can just let it slide
Enjoy the ride and stumble together
You take a waterslide
Splash in the summer, holding each other
You take a waterslide, a waterslide, oh

The silk on my shirt won't fade
My shoulders got a sign with your name
Let your eyes go ahead and reign, let 'em reign, oh
I know it from thе look of your face
You're tired and running in placе
I wanna be the change in your pace, pace

Groove all night in the living room
Get sky-high in the afternoon
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
We'll be coming soon
Baby"
John-Legend,Strawberry Blush,R&B,"You caught my eye-eye-eye
With your strawberry blush
Appeti-i-ite
For that red velvet lush
I got high, so super high up off that sweet sugar rush
Taste it, love, one taste is never enough

Coconut beach, girl of my dreams
Lookin' at me, servin' that peach, yeah
I wanna drink, pretty lil' face, uh
Cinnamon eyes, no, I ain't tryin'
To let it go to waste
I'ma clean up that plate

I want all of it, all of it, all of it, all the time
Want it all on the tip of my tongue, I'ma taste it right
Give me all of it, all of it, all of it, every night
From the very first try
I can't deny"
John-Legend,Guy Like Me,R&B,"She like the spotlight dancing in it all night
Just take a number 'cause you standing in a long line
I took my best shot and threw my hands to the sky
Yeah-yeah-yeah

Seen some girls overrated, beautiful and jaded
On a scale of one to ten, she more like an 80
She's a jackpot, lottery, rainbow in a pot of gold
So I let her know

I think a girl like you
Is perfect for a guy like me
(Think a girl, think a girl like you)
I bet a girl like you
Could make me wanna lose my sleep
(Think a girl, think a girl like you) ayy

We've been hotter than the Summer
Cooler than December
So cool baby, cool baby, woo baby, woo!
I think a girl like you"
John-Legend,Love,R&B,"Oh, oh
Oh-oh

Hush my baby, don't you cry
I'll dry your eyes
Fulfill your heart's desire
Let's go in, try again
Careful this time
Broken promises linger in our mind

Won't give in completely
Hearts break so easy
I know, believe me, oh, I've tried
But my arms can hold you
My kiss console you
I'll come and love you tonight

And I"
John-Legend,One Last Dance,R&B,"(Ha, ha, ha)
(Ha, ha, ha)
(Ha, ha, ha)

Sometimes I wander down the street
The place I swept you off your feet
I haven't seen you here in a while
That drink you love still taste the same
The DJ hasn't changed
Just put on our favorite record right now

When our melody plays
And I see your face
The memories waste
Right by to me

And I hope you give me one last dance
Head on my shoulder like it ain't over
Oh, this moment gave us one more chance"
John-Legend,All She Wanna Do,R&B,"She moves in peculiar ways
This room's nothing more than her stage
It's so cruel
The life of the party
She'll be the death of me

I told her, ""You're the love of my night
I won't stop 'til you're the love of my life
I won't stop 'til you're the one that I'm takin' home
One I've been waitin' for""

But all she wanna do is
All she wanna do is
All she wanna do is dance
All I wanna do is get up on her
Got me in the palm of her hands
All I wanna touch is her nirvana
Feels like I've been waitin' for
Forever and a night to get this chance

But all she wanna do is
All she wanna do is
All she wanna do is dance
All I wanna do is pull up closer
Got me in the palm of her hands
She don't want this song to be over
Feels like I've been waitin' for
Forever and a night to get this chance"
John-Legend,Nervous,R&B,"Adrenaline runnin' through my veins
I'm a skeleton when you say my name
And the high, no, it never goes away
Like jumpin' out an airplane to swimmin' with the sharks
That existential feelin' when you're starin' at the stars
There's a hurricane in my head
But the lightnin' in my heart makes it worth it
Yeah, I still get nervous

When you walk through the door
And you look in my eyes
Yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels like the very first time
I can fall for you forever, I'm certain
'Cause I still get nervous
When your lips hit my lips and the fireworks fly
Sendin' sparks through the air, like the Fourth of July
I can fall for you forever, I'm certain
'Cause I still get nervous"
John-Legend,Honey,R&B,"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Honey
Honey makes the world go 'round
World go 'round
Ain't it lovely
The way it feel when I go down?
I go down

A million of kingdoms would fall
So many crowns would be lost
All for a taste, I would pay any cost

You're sweeter than honey
Sweeter than honey
Worth more than money
Easy like Sunday, Sunday, Sunday
Sweeter than honey"
John-Legend,Home,R&B,"There some things that you should know
At times, the world gets awfully cold
I'll still be there
You'll grow up and make mistakes
Find the roads that are still unpaved
But I'll still be there

I can't catch your every fall
But I'll be there if you call
As long as my heart is beating
I can never stop the rain
But I'll comfort you in pain
As long as I'm still breathin'

I'll always love you more than you'll ever know
I'll always love you more than you'll ever know
I'll always love you, no matter where you go
Oh, you'll always have a home"
John-Legend,One Life,R&B,"Time stands still
When you feel like I feel
I forget where I was goin'
But I know who I'ma go with, is you
We're in motion, and I'm emotional, and I'm all over you
So what you wanna do?

Oh, if you don't mind
Closing your eyes
Just give me your time
'Cause you got all mine

We've got one life
I won't waste it, one life
I'm gon' taste the joy in every minute
Beginnin' 'til the finish
We've got one life
Get lost together, one life
We'll go wherever, 'til the ride is over
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go

Where we'll go
We don't know
Everywhere and nowhere, we'll go
Where we'll go
We don't know

Let's go everywhere and nowhere
Days turn night"
John-Legend,Bring Me Love,Holiday,"I don't need my stocking filled with toys
And I don't need no gifts to bring me joy

Baby, I hope Santa brings you to me
'Cause it's all I wished for this Christmas Eve

So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait, what are you still livin' home for?)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Your driver, his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh, we're both adults, so who's keepin' score?)

What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)
Ooh you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Then you really ought to go, go, go)"

We'll be cozy and warm until summer flowers bloom

Here in our midst, we're surely blessed"
John-Legend,The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire),Holiday,"All through the year we've waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
And winter time bringing the happiest season of all

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos, oh

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe"
John-Legend,Please Come Home For Christmas,Holiday,"Ah ha

Bells will be ringing the glad glad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing ""Silent Night""
Oh, Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas"
John-Legend,Wrap Me Up in Your Love,Holiday,"Wrap me up in your love, wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love

Let's enjoy the holiday, be here and now, this time and place
Laughter while the children play
These memories, they'll never fade
Let them open every gift, and while they do, we'll sneak a kiss
And Baby, when the day is through, my only gift is you

Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love
You've been at the top of my wish list
Hoping I've been good enough
(This season, you're my reason)
Oh, you know just what I want, yeah
(Both giving, both receiving)
So wrap me up in your love"
John-Legend,Merry Merry Christmas,Holiday,"Ever you ready, brother unite us
Ever you been bad, all the united

Woo, Christmas time with you
I made a little list of my favorite things to do
I count one, two, three four, up to ten
From the beginning until the end
Celebrating merry, merry Christmas time with you

So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
Have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)
'Cause I spent it with you
So have a merry, merry Christmas (Have a merry, merry Christmas)"
Taylor-Swift,Blank Space (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers"
Taylor-Swift,Out Of The Woods (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (back together)"
Taylor-Swift,Shake It Off (Taylor's Version),Pop,"I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', ""It's gonna be alright""

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mm-mm
That's what they don't see, mm-mm"
Taylor-Swift,Bad Blood (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So, take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe and
Rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound
Like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I"
Taylor-Swift,Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),Pop,"He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound"
Taylor-Swift,This Love (Taylor’s Version),Pop,"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead (oh oh oh)
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me (oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you"
Taylor-Swift,Clean (Taylor's Version),Pop,"The drought was the very worst
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

The rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room"
Taylor-Swift,Now That We Don't Talk (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Pop,"You went to a party, I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started
Did you get anxious, though, on the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long, you got new icons
And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I called my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less"
Taylor-Swift,Suburban Legends (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Pop,"You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever"
Taylor-Swift,Blank Space (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Nice to meet you, where you been?

Taylor-Swift,Style (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights

Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"

Taylor-Swift,I Wish You Would (Taylor's Version),Pop,"It's 2 a.m. in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say, ""It's in the past"", you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 a.m. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fightin' for and I"
