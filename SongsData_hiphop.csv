Kendrick-Lamar,United In Grief,Hip Hop,"I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
Tell them, tell 'em, tell them the truth
I hope you find some paradise (tell them, tell 'em the truth)
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell them your-

I've been goin' through somethin'
One thousand, eight hundred and 55 days
I've been goin' through somethin'
Be afraid

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killin' her
What is a relative, making repetitive narratives on how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents evil thirst

What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity

I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (whoa)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (whoa)
Started to feel like it's only one answer to everything, I don't know where it is (whoa)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (whoa)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Whoa)",0
Kendrick-Lamar,N95,Hip Hop,"Hello, new world
All the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside
But they still lied
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (take that shit off)

Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (take it off)

Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh-huh
Ugh, you ugly as fuck (you outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs, you steppin' or what? (You outta pocket)
Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (shoot, shoot, shoot, you out of pocket)",0

Eckhart Tolle
And this here is the big stepper

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and-

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through

Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messaging bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort

I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Die Hard,Hip Hop,"I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
I told you not to cry and held you close to me

I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop
Serafina, flame in ice
Where I'd be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

Do you love me? (Okay) Do you trust me? (Okay)
Can I trust you? (Okay) Don't judge me (okay)
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly (okay)
Too passionate, it gets ugly (okay)
Mmm, ah-ah",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Father Time,Hip Hop,"You really need some therapy
Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talking about?
Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck
Shit, everybody stupid
Yeah, well, you need to talk to someone
Reach out to Eckhart

I come from a generation of home invasions
And I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see

Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughing with my friends, they don't know my life

Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, ""That boy is exhausted"", he said, ""Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin"", I got up quick

I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Rich (Interlude),Hip Hop,"I learned in trappin', in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin' my dick sucked after the show
I ain't gonna lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we find our own

Runnin' in stores, kickin' in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon' live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify
Everybody ""gang-gang""
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink

Niggas shittin' where you sleep
Nigga shittin' where you eat
Who'da ever knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Rich Spirit,Hip Hop,"Takin' my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain't never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite
Universal shift, I'm in a groove and celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shakin' hand, firm grip rule
72 ways, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M's for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans, the GT diamond flippin' the kickstand (ooh)

Rich nigga, broke phone (ah)
Tryna keep the balance, I'm stayin' strong (ooh)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (yeah)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (ooh)
Ayy, bitch, I'm attractive (ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh (ooh)
Bitch, I'm attractive (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh

The morality can wait, feedback on low latency
I'm glitchin' from the face as my thoughts grow sacredly
I'm runnin' out of space, ask Whitney she okay
Never mind a hundred K, why you lyin' on Benjamin?
He turnin' in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn't give this shit away",0

Kendrick-Lamar,Purple Hearts,Hip Hop,"Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but

Whole life been social distant, h- like, ""When you not trippin'?""

I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon' judge your life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them h- is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they'll bless you back

Kendrick-Lamar,Count Me Out,Hip Hop,"We may not know which way to go on this dark road

(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult

Session ten, breakthrough

One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's one of you now
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?

It's a game to me, where the bedroom at? (And I'm tripping and falling)
Sleep, I ain't never had affairs with that
What's fed when the hearts and the words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back

I care too much, wanna share too much (and I'm tripping and falling)
In my head too much, I shut down too
I ain't there too much, I'm a complex soul
They layered me up, then broke me down
And morality's dust, I lack in trust

This time around, I trust myself (and I'm tripping and falling)
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself

Masks on the babies, mask on an opp (and I'm tripping and falling)
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in the lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride

Look myself in the mirror (and I'm tripping and falling)
Amityville, I ain't seen nothing scarier (on and on and on and on)",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Crown,Hip Hop,"You walk around, like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can't say no
Go out the way to make the coin available
That's what I call love

The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

But the time, it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say, ""No"" and all you've done gives them amnesia
One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody (I can't please everybody)

They idolize and praise your name across the nation
Tap the feed and nod the head for confirmation
Promise that you keep the music in rotation
That's what I call love (that's what I call love)",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Silent Hill,Hip Hop,"Hey, oh, yo

Pushin' the snakes, I'm pushin' the fakes
I'm pushin' 'em all off me like, ""Huh""

You funny, dawg
Peek-a-boo, can't hide behind your money, dawg

Kendrick-Lamar,Savior (Interlude),Hip Hop,"If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim
Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child
And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you

You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in the county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shooting niggas, blood on the highway
Crosses on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take everything that I ask for

Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showing a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did 43 shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way, put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love

Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped out the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love",0

Kendrick-Lamar,Auntie Diaries,Hip Hop,"Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't-
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
This is how we conceptualize human beings

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max's, gold chains and curl kits
'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played underground verbatim and stayed local

My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinking, ""I want me a bad bitch when I get big""
They hug on the corner like California king
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six by nines, keeping the music up under me

My auntie is a man now
I asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, ""ain't no telling
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Calling him anything but broke was less offending""

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say ""faggot""
""Faggot, faggot, faggot,"" we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it",0

Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee!

Enoch, your father's just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must have a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off writin' off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I'm a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes I'm afraid of my open mind

On my mind and it's heavy
Tear you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
It ain't about the business, shut the door now
It's a celebration
And if this sh- ain't bussin', what's it for now?

Steppin' out when the weight lifts",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Mother I Sober,Hip Hop,"I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standing on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five

I still feel it weighing on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clinging to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Staring at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I remember looking in the mirror knowing I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, ""Did he touch you Kendrick?""
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""
Frozen moments, still holding on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhyming, coping mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help

Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watching, live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear tell me that she sees me
""Did he touch you?"" I said ""No"" again, still they didn't believe me",0
Kendrick-Lamar,Mirror,Hip Hop,"(I choose me)

The pressure's taking over me, it's beginning to loom
Better if I spare your feelings and tell you the truth
Lately, I redirected my point of view
You won't grow waitin' on me

I can't live in the matrix, huh
Rather fall short of your graces, huh
This time I won't trade places, huh
Not about who's right, who's wrong, huh
Evolve, the only thing known, huh
Ask me when I'm coming home, huh
Blink twice again, I'm gone

Kendrick-Lamar,The Heart Part 5,Hip Hop,"As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment

Residue burned, missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain
Covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain

Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved

I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams, the culture

I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)

Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Head tricker, walk up closer
Ain't no Photoshoppin'

Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets

Kendrick-Lamar,untitled 08 | 09.06.2014.,Hip Hop,"Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have",0

To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped, like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts, we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it

I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sho' ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe to toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole, to blast at ya
Bass masters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sho blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called ""Foldin Clothes"", and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do, make a diamond, they just rhymin'",0

Temptations are taking a shortcut, but I don't
'Cause I ain't tryna be a almost, when I get it, I'ma float
Gone are the days we was close
Now when I see you, I look at you just like a ghost

I walk through the flame like I'm Teflon

I sucked up the pain and I kept goin'
Whole world know my namе, b-, my rep strong
We sold out in less than a hour
Thеse words I still sang like I'm slept on

Guess I'm lucky

Some of us don't get a second chance

But I ain't blowing this one

Nah, man!
Shit, I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water?
Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters

Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em

Eminem,Walk On Water,Hip Hop,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter–
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the— it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""",0

I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

""Wait! Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No, you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit

And the time it takes to do this shit

This road is takin' me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas

Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn

Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'

That means ""suicide"" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world
When you're the only one with the balls in your shorts

To leave their jaws on the floors with no re-morse
Remember that when they get to dogging you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to blogging about bologna, I'm not gonna stop
The saga continue, no stopping the force Obi, I'm mopping the floors
With them, I keep trying pass it, but they keep on dropping the torch
And it won't be long till this sport is O-V-E-R

I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be

Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce

Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)

Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black

But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit",0
Eminem,Stepdad (Intro),Hip Hop,"Get up
Dad, what?
What'd I fuckin' tell you about turnin' off the lights?",0
Eminem,Stepdad,Hip Hop,"Ayo
(This song's about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if see ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures that I draw
Shit that I've already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts

All I can hear is drama with mom and him
I can always hear arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker
Who sticks his dick in my mom (my mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him",0
Eminem,Marsh,Hip Hop,"My name is Marsh and this world, I'm out of it (out of it)
'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm startin' to sound like alphabet
Ha! I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was misled by the sound of it
How am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills
Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk

'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb
But the word fuckin' ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb

Hoe thinks her snatch is magical, but that's how she attracts
Men and who traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow

In fact, it'll be nothing to throw that lil' Bitch with a capital
B out the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit I'll aim at then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'd be great but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like invisible scratch pickles
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit
Like you accidentally ate a Louisville
Slugger and crapped it, I'd like to introduce myself
Hi there, bitch",0

You been through the hardest spot, ego, the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low the 'Vette look like a storm
Screamin' out no regrets
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit
I ain't havin' regrets
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm-

Yeah, they miss the old me (yeah)
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at them with no regrets, and I'm Hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moo Dee

Never took months to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane",0
Eminem,I Will,Hip Hop,"And I don't think that I can stop it (here it comes)

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, kill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will

I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four-inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Farrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, a bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine

Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beat boxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shotters
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, kill
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will

Yeah, I slaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like

She haunts me like no other (feel like)
Nobody told me (I don't know)
Love is pain, oh (I know we just met)
Black magic, dark water (but it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (it's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains

We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (sneeze)
Last time, I broke her collar bone, she's intolerablе (yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phеnomenal, though

We're an unlikely pair (yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (yeah)
People don't like us together, but like we care (not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals
For her with both of my feet bare (yeah)

But soon as I ask to hit (ask to hit)

Eminem,Alfred’s Theme,Hip Hop,"Before I check the mic (check, check, one, two)
I give it an extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (yeah)

I throw on my tux, then I (yeah) give zero fucks, then I (yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (uh), cup my nuts, then I (yeah)
Check my ball hair (what?), make sure it's all there (yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (yeah)
It's Music to Be Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill like a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (what?)

Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (visine) every time I drop (eye drop)

So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself

And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial

'Cause if I do, it's see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack, but always get attacked (yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (ew, yuck)

But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like

But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's
Like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (tossed my crayons)

Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and",0

What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (out), yeah (I need autotune)

It's my alter ego's fault
These evil thoughts can be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat, doze off to ""Rico Suave"" (look it up)
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel
A backpack full of Paxil, a black satchel, a knapsack
And a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels

Girl, let's go back, back to my castle (yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (stands for you, oh)
Wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (what?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you

I'm goin' in like the Red Roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks (yeah)
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're Scarface

In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race duckin' saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is I'm drivin' 'em all crazy (hahaha)

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (yeah, yeah)

I see the rap game, then attack the verses (uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (yeah)
Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (what?)
Pockets on stuffed like a taxidermist (woo)",0
Eminem,Higher,Hip Hop,"Yeah
You know I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove

I look at me now I'm thinkin, ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did, it's nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands

They hollerin', ""Shady""
Yellin' it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get a chance to get a crowd
I'll flip it around and have a crowd give me the chance
I've done it all, man
But in actuality I haven't, yet

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey (oh-oh-oh)
Really I have no idea
All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey (oh-oh-oh)
Really I have no idea
All I know it's every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get

To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain

Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
Looked at as a failure (yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause damn it I'm still the",0
Eminem,Lucky You,Hip Hop,"Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (yeah)
Pass the plate (yeah), where my drink (hol' up)?
This my day (yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (woo!), give me some room (hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (boom, bap), y'all gotta move (woo!), give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (yuh)
You might'a went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'

I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)

Run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)

They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (yeah, yeah)",0
Eminem,Normal,Hardcore Rap,"Yo, how do I keep (I don't know what's up with these hoes)
Getting in relationships like this (I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not till she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean
And now she starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house in her evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zoning to Jodeci",0
Eminem,Stepping Stone,Rap,"Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group

Shoot",0
Eminem,Not Alike,Rap,"Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!
Yeah

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
Daybed, iPod
May-back, Maybach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox

That's how much we have in common (yah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (yah)
That's how much we have in common (yuh!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's nada like us on the mic (yah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires is new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G

Everybody doin' chick joints
Probably rob these little dudes at fist point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel
Now everybody doin' Bitcoin
We don't got nothin' in common (no!)
We don't got nothin' in common (no!)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups
On them uppers-and-downers (woo!)

I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it

Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it",0
Maroon-5,Beautiful Mistakes,Alternative Rap,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk and fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like, ""One day, you'll come back to me""

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy)
Making beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe how every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off to keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was and still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality",0
Ed-Sheeran,Lonely Lovers,Hip Hop,"Sometimes, you can lose someone
And you won't ever feel the same no more
Wanna give up, it don't feel right
But you don't wanna feel this pain no more

Bad things come to those that don't deserve it
Why do I only pray when I'm hurtin'?
I might pour another glass
Wish I had one more chance to just have one more dance
A river full of tears, I'm swimmin' with the sharks
It's tearin' me apart, yeah
But we'll dance again in Heaven, my friend (Heaven, my friend)

It's been a while since I broke down in conversation
Little moments trigger memories when I talk about you
Hide the pain when only last year, it was always blatant
Acceptance comes eventually, man, 'cause what can you do?

Shut the world out, embrace the hurt
Nothin' can make it worse
So finish the bottle and open another, light up, inhale the burn
Everyone gets their turn
I still can't say the words, ""I miss you""

It's livin' wrong, getting this fucked up to forget
But I don't wanna be livin' the day filled up with regret
With words I should've said",0
Ed-Sheeran,Groundwork,Hip Hop,"Coming to ya from the outskirts
I've been waitin' outside for time but now they gonna let me in
But you gotta know one thing, all I ever do is win
Because of that groundwork (yeah)
I've been settin' this mic alight until the fight takes over

My team build upon many years of groundwork
Cuban look like yellow yam, points to the 'Gram
You know that pound work (pound work), you know how my sound work
Miss the fantastic, I'm a static, make them crowds surf
Lone ranger, I am always on the outskirts
Grab my .40, start playing 40-40
If the demon starts to haunt me (hahahahahaha), they leave and love it
My cannon said, ""Just fuck it"", on these fingers that will touch it

On the peak like Warren Buffett, like Norris, I just chuck it
Three stars in the moon, flick my wrist and I just bruk it (I just bruk it)
You know my steez
You get the borough to your belly button like Priest from Dancehall Queen
Hardcore settings, never been PG larger 'cause it's easy
Extraterrestrial, ET, thousand grams
Weezy connecting people, BT shoe
Flew off-key, Weezy move for the shadows, creepy
Look for the glasses, Stevie, and when the rhythm all easy, light white, easy-peasy

Know it's PDL in the dunya, I make a man unknown T, like munya",0
