Kendrick-Lamar,All The Stars,Soundtrack,"Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence and
Calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?",1
Kendrick-Lamar,Pray For Me,Soundtrack,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey",1

Eminem,Fall,College Rock,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
(It's too loud)
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud

Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away

These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face (Yuh)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)",1

Onerepublic,I Ain't Worried,Soundtrack,"I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
Keeping dreams alive (hey!), 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
Swimmin' in the floods (hey!), dancing on the clouds below
I ain't worried 'bout it

I ain't worried 'bout it
Hey!

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out, so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros",1
Onerepublic,Horizon (from One Night In Malibu),Pop,"Depuis toujours, le sens, nous l'avons cherché
Nous avons construit, nous avons détruit, nous avons conquit
Nous avons cédé à la violence de l'homme nourrit par la peur
Mais, c'est dans notre nature d'être poussés par l'espoir
Durant les nuits où défilent nos frayeurs
Nous prions pour qu'elles nous amènent plus loin, plus vite
Vers une imperceptible utopie",1
Onerepublic,Distance (from One Night In Malibu),Pop,"I don't wanna only call your name when I'm brokenhearted, yeah

If I let you get away, bury me today",1

And I know that you
Need someone to make it through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know that, ooh
Days like this I needed too, oh

So I'll take care of you (take care for you)
And honey, you'll take care of me too, (take care for you) yeah

I'll take care of you",1
Onerepublic,Good Life (from One Night In Malibu),Pop,"Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This is could really be a good life
A good, good life

Listen, to my friends in New York, I say ""Hello""
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about",1
Onerepublic,Rescue Me (from One Night In Malibu),Pop,"Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?

Would you rescue me?

Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?
When I need your love, if I need your help
Would you rescue me? Uh
Would you rescue me?

We don't talk much, not anymore
Broken bottles and slammin' doors
But we still care about each other
Say we care about each other
I know life took us far away
But I still dream 'bout the good old days
When we took care of each other
We were livin' for each other

If I'm slippin' under, under, oh

Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?
Would you take my call when I start to crack?
Would you rescue me? Uh",1
Onerepublic,Secrets (from One Night In Malibu),Pop,"I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly, I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect line
Don't care if critics ever jump in line

Driving shiny big black cars, yeah
Every day I see the news",1

Yeah, I just want to be wanted, oh

I just want to be more than a drop in the sea",1
Onerepublic,Lose Somebody (from One Night In Malibu),Pop,"It's a classic me mistake
Someone gives me love
And I throw it all away

Talkin' to myself
But I don't know what to say

'Cause you let go
And now I'm holdin' on
I guess you don't know what you got
Until it's gone

Waking up in California
But these clouds, they won't go away

I close my eyes and I say",1
Onerepublic,Run (From One Night In Malibu),Pop,"When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run

All that glitters don't turn to gold
But until then just have your fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run""
Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run

When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run",1
Onerepublic,I Lived (from One Night In Malibu),Pop,"Hope when you take that jump
You don't feel the fall
I hope when the water rises
You built a wall
I hope when the crowd screams out
They're screaming your name
I hope if everybody runs
You choose to stay

I hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad
The only way you can know
You gave it all you had
And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain
I hope when the moment comes
You'll say

I, I, I, I did it all
I, I, I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
Saw so many places, the things that I did",1

Young, but I'm not that bold

Just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong, doing the right thing
Couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Swear I saw your face
At a coffee shop on 8th
Or maybe it was in my mind?
And I swear that I heard your laugh
From a person that walked past me
At a party the other night

How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?

When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine

And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

I begged you to let me in, 'cause I only want to be the cure

Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere

Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?

Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

Means to lose all the things I can't live without

Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light",1
Adele,When We Were Young,Soul,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment?
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me, of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here",1
Adele,Remedy,Pop,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be
Every story has it's scars

But when the pain cuts you deep
And when the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see",1
Adele,Water Under the Bridge,Pop,"If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?

And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me",1
Adele,River Lea,Pop,"Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child, I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

Oh, I can't go back
But the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain",1
Adele,Love In The Dark,Pop,"Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore

Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me",1
Adele,Rolling in the Deep,Pop,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair",1
Adele,He Won't Go,Pop,"Some say, I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew

I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you've left behind

Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified
I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying

I heard his voice today",1
Adele,Melt My Heart to Stone,Pop,"Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love",1
Adele,Right As Rain,Pop,"Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say, ""I chose to be alone""
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off, and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off, we
Won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything",1
Adele,My Same,Pop,"Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye
Aye, aye, aye-aye

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving nothing way too much, in fact

I say we've only known each other a year
You say, ""Pfft, I've known you longer, my dear""
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, do-do-do",1
Adele,Tired,Pop,"Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile",1
Adele,Daydreamer,Pop,"Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw-dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch",1
Adele,Best for Last,Pop,"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me? Yeah",1
Adele,Crazy For You,Pop,"Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am, I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race",1
Adele,Melt My Heart to Stone,Pop,"Right under my feet is air made of bricks

Adele,First Love,Pop,"So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind",1

Adele,"That's It, I Quit, I'm Movin' On (Live at Hotel Cafe)",Pop,"When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door and leave me standing there
Oh, honey, that's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it every place, yeah
Yeah, that's it
Honey, I quit, I'm movin' on
Oh",1
Adele,Crazy For You (Live at Hotel Cafe),Pop,"Found myself today

So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise)
My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry)
My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait, what are you still livin' home for?)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Your driver, his name is Murray)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh, we're both adults, so who's keepin' score?)

What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice)
If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice)

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

And baby, now we got bad blood

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak?

Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead (oh oh oh)
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me (oh oh oh)

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

The rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room",1
Taylor-Swift,Now That We Don't Talk (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Pop,"You went to a party, I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started
Did you get anxious, though, on the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long, you got new icons
And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I called my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less",1
Taylor-Swift,Suburban Legends (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Pop,"You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever",1

Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers",1
Taylor-Swift,Style (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights

Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style",1
Taylor-Swift,Out Of The Woods (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (back together)",1
Taylor-Swift,I Wish You Would (Taylor's Version),Pop,"It's 2 a.m. in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say, ""It's in the past"", you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 a.m. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fightin' for and I",1
Taylor-Swift,Bad Blood (Taylor's Version),Pop,"Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So, take a look what you've done
Cause baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe and
Rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound
Like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I",1
Taylor-Swift,Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version),Pop,"He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound",1
Taylor-Swift,This Love (Taylor’s Version),Pop,"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead (oh oh oh)
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me (oh oh oh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night for only you",1
