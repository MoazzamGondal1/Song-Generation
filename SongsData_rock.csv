Onerepublic,Time,Rock,"Six on the second hand to New Year's resolutions
And there's just no question what this man should do
Take all the time lost, all the days that I cost
Take what I took and give it back to you

All this time we were waiting for each other

Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in

The master of my sea, oh (ooh)

I was broken from a young age, taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
Who look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the, c'mon

I get a little bit bigger
But, then, I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am?

Right to the top, don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little-

Some nights, I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes, I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, and a day in a life
Mixing it up, checkin' it twice
Trying to breathe, starting to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

Gonna make it

Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me

Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price (you pay)

Leave behind your heart and cast (away)
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than (the prey)
And you're standing on the edge face up

'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world",2
Imagine-Dragons,Next to Me (Acoustic) (Live in Vegas),Alternative,"Something about the way that you walked into my living room

Even in the city of sin

Seems there's something in the air today
It's got me feeling, oh, a certain way
Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I'm done
Keep thinking, what am I supposed to do?

My heart is filled with reasons

I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself

'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, and a day in a life
Mixing it up, checkin' it twice
Trying to breathe, starting to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (sometimes, I can get a little)",2

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day

Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past
